# Kitui County Projects Dashboard

An interactive data dashboard and analysis notebook for visualizing development projects across Kitui Central, a subcounty in Kenya. This project includes Plotly visualizations, a Jupyter Notebook, and a custom HTML dashboard that brings insights to life.

## Project Summary

- Budget allocation (total and average) by ward and subcounty  
- Project distribution across wards and financial years  
- Types of projects implemented and their statuses
